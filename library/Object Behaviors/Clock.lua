---# Clock
---The Clock behavior is present on the Digital Clock object.
---## Clock Modes
---- *Current Time*: Displays the current time of the host.
---- *Stopwatch*: Displays a running count up.
---- *Timer*: Displays a countdown and beeps once complete.
---@class Clock
---@field paused bool If the clock timer is paused.
---@field getValue fun(): int Current time in stopwatch or timer mode. Clock mode returns 0. This function acts the same as [Object's getValue()](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/object/#getvalue).
---@field pauseStart fun(): bool Pauses/resumes a Clock in stopwatch or timer mode.
---Set the timer to display a number of seconds. This function acts the same as [Object's setValue()](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/object/#setvalue). 
---If the Clock is not in timer mode, it will be switched. If it is in timer mode, it will be paused and the remaining time will be changed.
---This will not start the countdown on its own.
---
---*@param* `seconds` â€” How many seconds will be counted down.
