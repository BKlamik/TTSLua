---# Introduction
--->### ðŸš¨ Danger
--->Component APIs are an advanced feature. An **understanding of how Unity works is required** to utilize them.
---A Component is a collection of functions and variables that allow you to control object behavior.
---
---Components are a [Unity concept](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html), they're the building blocks that
---Tabletop Simulator objects are composed of.
---## Components
---GameObjects are themselves made up of [Components](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/components/component/). A
---typical GameObject would contain a Collider, Transform, Mesh etc. These Components describe the GameObject's
---behavior and visual representation.
---
--->### ðŸ”¥ Tip
--->In addition to built\-in Objects, the Component APIs provide access the GameObjects and Components that exist in
---AssetBundles. This means that when creating an AssetBundle, you may attach all manner of components (lights, sounds
---etc.) and you'll be able to control them via these APIs.
---
---## Vars
---Each Component has **Vars**. These are variables which you can modify to change how that Component affects the
---GameObject it composes.
---
---## Materials
---GameObjects with Renderer components typically also have attached
---[Materials](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/components/material/), which govern the appearance of the object.

---Every object in Tabletop Simulator is a [GameObject](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/components/gameobject/). When
---a game is created, GameObjects are loaded, initialized and some of these top-level GameObjects are then exposed via
---Tabletop Simulator's Lua scripting APIs as regular Objects, each with their own scripting contexts.
---
---Some Lua-exposed Objects are made-up of hierarchy of children GameObjects. The Component APIs allow to access and
---interact with these children GameObjects (which you'd otherwise be unable to control).
