---@meta Joints

---# Joints
---### ⚠️ This class and its subclasses are abstract classes
---They do not really exist in Tabletop Simulator's Lua API. They are just interfaces to help with the
---[jointTo()](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/object/#jointto) and
---[getJoints()](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/object/#getjoints) functions.
---@class JointType

---
---Parameters used to create a Spring joint with [jointTo()](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/object/#jointto).

---@field collision? bool
---@field break_force? float Force required to break the joint. *Optional, defaults to infinity*
---Torque required to break the joint. *Optional, defaults to infinity*
---<ul><b>⚠️ This parameter is spelled as "break_torgue" internally</b></ul>
---@field break_torgue? float
---Where the joint is attached to on this object, relative to this object's center.
---*Optional, defaults to {x=0, y=0, z=0}*
---<ul><b>⚠️ Not officially documented for Spring Joints</b></ul>
---@field anchor? Vector
---Where to attach the joint on the object the joint is connecting to, relative to the object's center.
---*Optional, default depends on position of the objects*
---<ul><b>⚠️ Not officially documented for Spring Joints</b></ul>
---@field connector_anchor? Vector
---@field spring? float How much spring force to apply to keep the objects together. *Optional, defaults to 10*

---*Optional, defaults to 0*
---@field max_distance? float
---The minimum distance the spring can contract to, relative to the initial distance between the objects when the joint is applied.
